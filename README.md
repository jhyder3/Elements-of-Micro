# Elements-of-Micro

This repo will contain materials for weekly discussions on Greg Mankiw's "Principles of Microeconomics." These materials are designed for Johns Hopkins' Fall 2025 Elements of Micro course, taught by professor Muhammad Husain.

The "slides" folder contains (surprise!) the slides for each week's discussion. The "practice problems" folder contains (again, surprsise) the practice problems we will go over in our discussion section each week; the solutions will also be posted once we have discussed them. I encourage you to try the practice problems before coming to our discussion section! The "tex" folder contains the code that compiles the slides and the practice problems, and is not something most students will need to worry about.
